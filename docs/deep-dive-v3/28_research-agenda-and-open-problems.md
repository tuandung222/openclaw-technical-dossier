# 28 - Research Agenda And Open Problems

## Open problem 1

Adaptive policy tuning without violating explicit security intent.

## Open problem 2

Joint optimization of latency, quality, and safety under dynamic provider reliability.

## Open problem 3

Memory retrieval confidence calibration under mode-switch (vector -> fts-only).

## Open problem 4

Causal attribution: phân rã phần đóng góp của model/tool/retrieval/policy vào output quality.

## Research tracks

- bandit-based fallback scheduling
- uncertainty-aware retrieval scoring
- policy explainability via counterfactual traces
- robust multi-channel agent benchmarking standards
