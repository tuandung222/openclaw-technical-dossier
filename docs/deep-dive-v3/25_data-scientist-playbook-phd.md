# 25 - Data Scientist Playbook (PhD)

## Measurement philosophy

Đánh giá phải kết nối:

- model behavior
- policy constraints
- channel context
- user outcomes

## Evaluation stack

1. offline benchmark suites
2. replay-based simulation
3. shadow online evaluation
4. production guardrail metrics

## Key models to build

- fallback success predictor
- approval friction predictor
- retrieval relevance estimator
- latency decomposition model

## Statistical discipline

- stratify by channel and task type
- report uncertainty bounds
- avoid leakage from post-policy outcomes into pre-policy predictors
